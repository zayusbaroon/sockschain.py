This is a very concise implementation of the SOCKS5 protocol (RFC 1928) in Python that supports and encourages chaining of multiple SOCKS5 proxies ("links"). This script was created with a very specific use case in mind, and as a result
is not terribly extensible. However, it is very easy to adapt as needed and may become the basis for future projects, if sufficient inspiration strikes.
