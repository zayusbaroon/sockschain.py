This is a very concise implementation of the SOCKS5 protocol (RFC 1928) in Python that supports and encourages chaining of multiple SOCKS5 proxies ("links"). This script was created with a very specific use case in mind, and as a result
is not immediately convenient for general usage. However, it is easy to adapt as needed by virtue of its size and may become the basis for future projects, if sufficient inspiration and/or necessity strikes.
